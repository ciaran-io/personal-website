      Welcome to my personal portfolio. I first began my coding journey back in
      2018 when I needed to develop a website for my health store business. I
      started with a small Wordpress website to reach out to customers and offer
      products online.
      <br /><br />
      Fast forward to 2020 & I decided to follow my passion and made the
      decision to change careers & become a web developer. Currently i'm
      studying full stack web development with the
      <nuxt-link
        class="underline-offset-3 inline-block underline after:content-['_â†—']"
        to="https://codeinstitute.net"
        target="blank"
        >Code Institute</nuxt-link
      >
      with the goal of receiving a diploma in full stack software development.
      <br /><br />
      The skills I obtained over the last few years are predominately focused on
      frontend web development; I have however built web applications using
      backend technologies such as node.js & worked with databases, servers &
      API's. Write now my focus is on design & development of websites, however
      I would like to learn more about JavaScript data structures & algorithms
      along with Python for automation & more.
      <br /><br />
      I have a passion for web design, user experience & web performance & look
      forward to taking on new challenges, improving my knowledge & keeping up
      with latest web technologies and web standards.
